### Hi there 👋, my name is Ivan G.

Frontend Engineer with 15+ years’ experience delivering web applications, design systems and marketing platforms that drive user acquisition.

My expertise lies in building high-performance web platforms that scale for global brands. Over the years, I’ve specialised in React, Next.js, TypeScript and distributed front-end architectures, helping organisations modernise their platforms, accelerate delivery pipelines and meet compliance requirements at enterprise scale.

What drives me most is bringing people and technology together.

Outside of day-to-day delivery, I enjoy sharing knowledge: whether it’s mentoring developers, speaking at meetups, contributing to open source, or running hackathons that spark new ideas and innovation. For me, engineering leadership is about more than just code - it’s about empowering teams to solve complex challenges and create meaningful impact at scale.

- 🚀 Most recently Lead Frontend Engineer at Bumble/Badoo (2017–2025)
- 🧩 I enjoy turning large legacy UIs into typed, maintainable React/TypeScript systems
- 🕹️ Into retro tech, classic handheld consoles
